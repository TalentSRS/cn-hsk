  The Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì (HSK), (Chinese: 汉语水平考试), translated as Chinese
  Proficiency Test, or Chinese Standard Exam, is China's only standardized
  test of Standard Chinese language proficiency for non-native speakers such as
  foreign students and overseas Chinese.

  Development began in 1984 at Beijing Language and Culture University and in
  1992 the HSK was officially made a national standardized test. By 2005, over
  120 countries had participated as regular host sites and the tests had been
  taken around 100 million times (including by domestic ethnic minority
  candidates). The general count outside of China is stated as being around
  1.9 million. In 2011 Beijing International Chinese College became the first
  HSK testing center to conduct online HSK test.

  The HSK test approximates the English TOEFL, and an HSK certificate is valid
  without any limitation in China. The test aims to be a certificate of language
  proficiency for higher educational and professional purposes.

  Each year HSK certificates are issued to those who meet required scores.
  Unlike the Test of Chinese as a Foreign Language offered in Taiwan and
  administered in traditional Chinese characters, the HSK is administered in
  Simplified Chinese. In addition test takers with outstanding results can win a
  scholarship for short-term language study in China.
